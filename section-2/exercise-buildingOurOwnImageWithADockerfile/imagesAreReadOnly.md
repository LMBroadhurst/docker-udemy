# Changing code...
- If we change code, e.g. the header my course goal...
- Then stop the container and re-run the previously built container...
- The change is not picked up

- Need to build a new image for the code change to be picked up
- Images are 'locked' snapshots of code once built. They cannot be edited.
- READ ONLY.
- Need to rebuild the image to get the new updated code/image.
